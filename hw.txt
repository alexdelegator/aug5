For HW:
1) Create a game - Closest to the wall :
a) (מי הכי קרוב לקיר). Create a "wall" in the right side of the screen, and add a circle in the left side of it.  
b) Add a button: when clicking it - it start moving the circle towards the wall.
c) When the circle is in move - another click on the button stops it.
d) Your goal is to stop the circle as close as you can to the wall, but if you touch it - you fail.
e) Keep the best score in the local storage and present it also in the ui.

2) Create a plugin that runs on all  link elements (<a>) with href attribute - and create s a DIV element above it with black background and white text with the content of its href attribute. For example - for this element <a href="http://www.nba.com">ZAZA</a>  -> it will create a div above that looks like this: http://www.nba.com
(But please add some padding so it will look nice).
